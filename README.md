# react-web-practice

See how my React web skills are with a ~2 hour challenge!

## Task

- [ ] Show user a page where they can select what staff type they are
- [ ] Use the selected staff type to show a list of available positions
  - [ ] Use this source for the data: `https://vvgv5rubu3.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/sessions`

## Goals (minimum)

- [ ] Functionality listed under "Task" heading
- [ ] Add instructions for running (and testing) to this readme
- [ ] Ensure a11y fundamentals are present (contrast, labels, tabbing, alt text, semantic html)
- [ ] Add unit tests (Jest)
- [ ] Add component tests (react testing library?)
- [ ] Add basic error handling
- [ ] Add basic loading state handling

## Nice to have

- [ ] e2e (cypress) tests
- [ ] Nicer styling
- [ ] Persisted data (e.g. save staff type to localstorage and use that to rehydrate state on pageload)
